## how can something like this be dangerous for me?
When you send the link in a Discord chat, it seems to be a normal image that just doesn't load. Now you might think that it must lead to a normal image and you click the "Open original" button in Discord to open the image in the browser. Now it could lead to a Discord phishing page or some other bad website.
